          <p>Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes inspiration from <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>. The central idea is that you build your UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. When a widget’s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework diffs against the previous description in order to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render tree to transition from one state to the next.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <article>
        <p>The minimal Flutter app simply calls the runApp() function with a widget:</p>
        <code id="coding">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
void main() {
  runApp(
    Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, world!',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
      ),
    ),
  );
}</code>
        <p>The <code>runApp()</code> function takes the given <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html">Widget</a> and makes it the root of the widget tree. In this example, the widget tree consists of two widgets, the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html">Center</a> widget and its child, the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html">Text</a> widget. The framework forces the root widget to cover the screen, which means the text “Hello, world” ends up centered on screen. The text direction needs to be specified in this instance; when the <code>MaterialApp</code> widget is used, this is taken care of for you, as demonstrated later.</p>

<p>When writing an app, you’ll commonly author new widgets that are subclasses of either <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html">StatelessWidget</a> or <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html">StatefulWidget</a>, depending on whether your widget manages any state. A widget’s main job is to implement a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html">build()</a> function, which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets. The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html">RenderObject</a>, which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Flutter comes with a suite of powerful basic widgets, of which the following are commonly used:</p>
        <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html">Text</a>
        <p>The <code>Text</code> widget lets you create a run of styled text within your application.</p><br>
        <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html">Row</a>, <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html">Column</a>
        <p>These flex widgets let you create flexible layouts in both the horizontal (<code>Row</code>) and vertical (<code>Column</code>) directions. The design of these objects is based on the web’s flexbox layout model.</p><br>
        <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html">Stack</a>
        <p>Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically), a <code>Stack</code> widget lets you place widgets on top of each other in paint order. You can then use the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Positioned-class.html">Positioned</a> widget on children of a <code>Stack</code> to position them relative to the top, right, bottom, or left edge of the stack. Stacks are based on the web’s absolute positioning layout model.</p><br>
        <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html">Container</a>
        <p>The <code>Container</code> widget lets you create a rectangular visual element. A container can be decorated with a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/BoxDecoration-class.html">BoxDecoration</a>, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. A <code>Container</code> can also have margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a <code>Container</code> can be transformed in three dimensional space using a matrix.</p>
        <p>Below are some simple widgets that combine these and other widgets:</p>
        <code id="coding">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyAppBar extends StatelessWidget {
  MyAppBar({this.title});

  // Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked "final".

  final Widget title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 56.0, // in logical pixels
      padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.blue[500]),
      // Row is a horizontal, linear layout.
      child: Row(
        // &ltWidget&gt is the type of items in the list.
        children: &ltWidget&gt[
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
            tooltip: 'Navigation menu',
            onPressed: null, // null disables the button
          ),
          // Expanded expands its child to fill the available space.
          Expanded(
            child: title,
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            tooltip: 'Search',
            onPressed: null,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyScaffold extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Material is a conceptual piece of paper on which the UI appears.
    return Material(
      // Column is a vertical, linear layout.
      child: Column(
        children: &ltWidget&gt[
          MyAppBar(
            title: Text(
              'Example title',
              style: Theme.of(context).primaryTextTheme.headline6,
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Hello, world!'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    title: 'My app', // used by the OS task switcher
    home: MyScaffold(),
  ));
}</code>
        <p>Be sure to have a <code>uses-material-design: true</code> entry in the <code>flutter</code> section of your <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file. It allows you to use the predefined set of <a href="https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline">Material icons</a>. It’s generally a good idea to include this line if you are using the Materials library.</p>
        <code id="coding">name: my_app
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true</code>
          <p>Many Material Design widgets need to be inside of a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html">MaterialApp</a> to display properly, in order to inherit theme data. Therefore, run the application with a <code>MaterialApp</code>.</p>

<p>The MyAppBar widget creates a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html">Container</a> with a height of 56 device-independent pixels with an internal padding of 8 pixels, both on the left and the right. Inside the container, <code>MyAppBar</code> uses a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html">Row</a> layout to organize its children. The middle child, the <code>title</code> widget, is marked as <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html">Expanded</a>, which means it expands to fill any remaining available space that hasn’t been consumed by the other children. You can have multiple <code>Expanded</code> children and determine the ratio in which they consume the available space using the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html#flex">flex</a> argument to <code>Expanded</code>.</p>

            <p>The <code>MyScaffold</code> widget organizes its children in a vertical column. At the top of the column it places an instance of <code>MyAppBar</code>, passing the app bar a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html">Text</a> widget to use as its title. Passing widgets as arguments to other widgets is a powerful technique that lets you create generic widgets that can be reused in a wide variety of ways. Finally, <code>MyScaffold</code> uses an <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html">Expanded</a> to fill the remaining space with its body, which consists of a centered message.</p>

      <header>Using Material Components</header>
      <article>
        <p>Flutter provides a number of widgets that help you build apps that follow Material Design. A Material app starts with the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html">MaterialApp</a> widget, which builds a number of useful widgets at the root of your app, including a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html">Navigator</a>, which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings, also known as “routes”. The <code>Navigator</code> lets you transition smoothly between screens of your application. Using the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html">MaterialApp</a> widget is entirely optional but a good practice.</p>
        <code id="coding">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    title: 'Flutter Tutorial',
    home: TutorialHome(),
  ));
}

class TutorialHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold is a layout for the major Material Components.
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        leading: IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
          tooltip: 'Navigation menu',
          onPressed: null,
        ),
        title: Text('Example title'),
        actions: &ltWidget&gt[
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            tooltip: 'Search',
            onPressed: null,
          ),
        ],
      ),
      // body is the majority of the screen.
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, world!'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        tooltip: 'Add', // used by assistive technologies
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
        onPressed: null,
      ),
    );
  }
}</code>
        <p>Now that the code has switched from <code>MyAppBar</code> and <code>MyScaffold</code> to the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html">AppBar</a> and <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html">Scaffold</a> widgets, and from material.dart, the app is starting to look at bit more Material. For example, the app bar has a shadow and the title text inherits the correct styling automatically. A floating action button is also added.</p>

          <p>Notice that widgets are passed as arguments to other widgets. The <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html">Scaffold</a> widget takes a number of different widgets as named arguments, each of which are placed in the <code>Scaffold</code> layout in the appropriate place. Similarly, the AppBar widget lets you pass in widgets for the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html#leading">leading</a> widget, and the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html#actions">actions</a> of the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html#title">title</a> widget. This pattern recurs throughout the framework and is something you might consider when designing your own widgets.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Handling_Gestures">
      <header>Handling Gestures</header>
      <article>
        <p>Most applications include some form of user interaction with the system. The first step in building an interactive application is to detect input gestures. See how that works by creating a simple button:</p>
        <code id='coding'>class MyButton extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        print('MyButton was tapped!');
      },
      child: Container(
        height: 36.0,
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5.0),
          color: Colors.lightGreen[500],
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Engage'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}</code>
        <p>The <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html">GestureDetector</a> widget doesn’t have a visual representation but instead detects gestures made by the user. When the user taps the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html">Container</a>, the <code>GestureDetector</code> calls its <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html#onTap">onTap()</a> callback, in this case printing a message to the console. You can use <code>GestureDetector</code> to detect a variety of input gestures, including taps, drags, and scales.</p>
        <p>Many widgets use a <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html">GestureDetector</a> to provide optional callbacks for other widgets. For example, the <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html">IconButton</a>, <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html">ElevatedButton</a>, and <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html">FloatingActionButton</a> widgets have <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html#onPressed">onPressed()</a> callbacks that are triggered when the user taps the widget.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/advanced/gestures">Gestures</a> in Flutter.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Keys">
      <header>Keys</header>
      <article>
        <p>Use keys to control which widgets the framework matches up with other widgets when a widget rebuilds. By default, the framework matches widgets in the current and previous build according to their <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html#runtimeType">runtimeType</a> and the order in which they appear. With keys, the framework requires that the two widgets have the same <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Key-class.html">key</a> as well as the same <code>runtimeType</code>.</p>
        <p>Keys are most useful in widgets that build many instances of the same type of widget. For example, the <code>ShoppingList</code> widget, which builds just enough <code>ShoppingListItem</code> instances to fill its visible region:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Without keys, the first entry in the current build would always sync with the first entry in the previous build, even if, semantically, the first entry in the list just scrolled off screen and is no longer visible in the viewport.</li><br>
          <li>By assigning each entry in the list a “semantic” key, the infinite list can be more efficient because the framework syncs entries with matching semantic keys and therefore similar (or identical) visual appearances. Moreover, syncing the entries semantically means that state retained in stateful child widgets remains attached to the same semantic entry rather than the entry in the same numerical position in the viewport.</li><br>
          <li>Empty</li><br>
          <li>Empty</li><br>
          <li>Empty</li>
        </ul>
